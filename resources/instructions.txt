- Choose a PHP MVC Framework of your choice,
- Choose a free REST API service to get weather data (like https://openweathermap.org or https://www.weatherapi.com)
- Create a small application to get and store in a MySQL database the weather data of Montreal for the next 4 hours (see details below),
- The data need to be fetch and store every 30 minutes by a cron job,
- Create a small documentation (a text file) to quickly explain how to install and set your application (config/settings and SQL dump of your data structure).

Note:
- if you choose weatherapi, you need to get and store the following data: https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/#apis-realtime
- if you choose openweathermap, you need to get and store the following data: https://openweathermap.org/current#parameter

The project needs to integrate an unit test.
